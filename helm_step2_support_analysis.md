| S2P2 | 1 | No native retrieval infrastructure; basic embedding model support only |
| S2P3 | 0 | No vector search benchmark preparation utilities |
| S2P4 | 1 | Basic model metadata registry; limited validation capabilities |
| S2P5 | 2 | Built-in scenario generation framework but limited adversarial tools |
| S2P6 | 2 | Deterministic splits supported but manual implementation required |

## Detailed Analysis

### S2P1: Load and validate datasets with modality-specific preprocessing
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive multimedia object support in `src/helm/common/media_object.py` with `MediaObject` and `MultimediaObject` classes supporting text, image, audio, video through MIME types
- Dedicated multimodal prompt handling in `src/helm/benchmark/adaptation/adapters/multimodal/multimodal_prompt.py`
- Extensive scenario framework in `src/helm/benchmark/scenarios/` with 150+ scenarios covering multiple modalities
- Audio-language models supported (`AUDIO_LANGUAGE_MODEL_TAG` in model metadata)
- Vision-language models extensively supported (`VISION_LANGUAGE_MODEL_TAG`, `FULL_FUNCTIONALITY_VLM_TAG`)
- Data preprocessing pipeline in `src/helm/benchmark/data_preprocessor.py` with `DataAugmenter` support
- Format validation through MIME type checking and file existence validation in media objects
**Limitations:**
None significant - excellent multimodal support with proper validation

### S2P2: Build retrieval infrastructure
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Model metadata registry includes `EMBEDDING_MODEL_TAG` for embedding models
- No dedicated document encoding or indexing utilities found
- No FAISS, ColBERT, or BM25 integration
- No corpus preprocessing or chunking utilities
- Binary ranking adapter exists (`binary_ranking_adapter.py`) but limited to ranking tasks
**Limitations:**
Significant gaps - would require external implementation for retrieval infrastructure

### S2P3: Prepare vector search benchmarks
**Rating:** 0
**Evidence:**
- No vector loading utilities found
- No kNN computation or ground truth preparation tools
- No vector normalization or distance computation utilities
- No benchmark preparation tools for vector search
**Limitations:**
Complete absence of vector search benchmark preparation capabilities

### S2P4: Validate model artifacts
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Model metadata registry in `src/helm/benchmark/model_metadata_registry.py` with comprehensive model information
- Model deployment registry tracks deployments
- Basic model configuration validation through ObjectSpec system
- No checksum verification utilities found
- No integrity checking beyond basic configuration validation
**Limitations:**
Limited to metadata and configuration; no cryptographic validation or dependency checking

### S2P5: Generate evaluation scenarios
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive scenario generation framework with 150+ built-in scenarios
- Scenario base class in `src/helm/benchmark/scenarios/scenario.py` enables custom scenario creation
- Template system through scenario inheritance and configuration
- Data augmentation framework in `src/helm/benchmark/augmentations/` with perturbations
- Multi-turn dialogue support in various scenarios
- Adversarial scenarios exist (e.g., `decodingtrust_adv_*_scenario.py`) but limited
**Limitations:**
Limited adversarial input generation tools; mostly focused on standard evaluation scenarios

### S2P6: Create deterministic data splits
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Split support built into Instance and Scenario classes with `TRAIN_SPLIT`, `VALID_SPLIT`, `TEST_SPLIT` constants
- Reproducible splits supported through seed parameters (found in `raft_scenario.py` with `train_test_split(seed=self.random_seed)`)
- Instance ID assignment through `with_instance_ids()` function
- Some scenarios implement custom splitting with random states (e.g., `seahelm_scenario.py`)
- Manual stratification implementation required in individual scenarios
**Limitations:**
No centralized split management utilities; stratification and custom splitting strategies must be implemented per-scenario

## Overall Assessment

HELM is primarily designed as an evaluation framework rather than a data preparation platform. It excels at Step 2 Process 1 (multimodal data loading and preprocessing) with comprehensive support across text, image, audio, and video modalities. However, it has significant gaps in retrieval infrastructure (S2P2) and vector search preparation (S2P3), which would require substantial external tooling.

The framework provides a solid foundation for scenario generation (S2P5) and supports deterministic data splits (S2P6), though these require manual implementation in many cases. Model validation capabilities (S2P4) are basic, focusing on metadata rather than cryptographic integrity.

For organizations requiring comprehensive Step 2 PREPARE support, HELM would need significant extensions or integration with specialized tools for retrieval and vector search capabilities.
