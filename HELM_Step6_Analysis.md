# HELM - Step 6 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S6P1 | 2 | JSON artifacts, logs bundling, but limited metadata tracking |
| S6P2 | 2 | JSON exports, LaTeX tables, web UI, but no PDF/HTML export |
| S6P3 | 2 | Web interface, matplotlib plots, but no interactive dashboards |
| S6P4 | 1 | Basic run configs saved, limited environment capture |
| S6P5 | 1 | GitHub Actions integration, but no MLOps platform connectors |

## Detailed Analysis

### S6P1: Package evaluation artifacts
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- HELM saves comprehensive JSON artifacts for each run in structured directories (`benchmark_output/runs/<suite>/<run_name>/`)
- Key artifacts include: `run_spec.json`, `scenario.json`, `scenario_state.json`, `stats.json`, `per_instance_stats.json`
- Supports scenario instance caching with `input_instances.json` files
- Logs and traces are captured in the scenario state JSON files
- Directory structure: `src/helm/benchmark/runner.py` lines 183-187, 331-346

**Limitations:**
- No built-in compression utilities for artifact bundles
- Limited metadata tracking beyond basic run specifications
- No dedicated artifact versioning system beyond directory naming
- No automated packaging tools for bundling related artifacts

### S6P2: Generate standardized reports  
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- JSON export through `helm-summarize` command producing structured data files
- LaTeX table generation via `table_to_latex()` function in `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/table.py`
- Web-based executive dashboards through `helm-server` command with HTML interface
- Comprehensive schema system for report formatting in `src/helm/benchmark/static/` directory
- CSV references found in configuration files for data input/output

**Limitations:**
- No direct PDF generation capability (only LaTeX output)
- Limited executive dashboard features - mainly data tables and basic visualizations
- No compliance documentation or audit report generation
- No standardized leaderboard export formats beyond web interface

### S6P3: Create interactive visualizations and exploratory tools
**Rating:** 2  
**Evidence:**
- Web frontend interface at `helm-frontend/` with interactive data exploration
- Matplotlib-based plotting system in `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/create_plots.py`
- Static web server with data visualization capabilities (`src/helm/benchmark/server.py`)
- Table-based data presentation with sorting and filtering in web interface
- PNG/PDF plot export support

**Limitations:**
- No plotly, bokeh, or other modern interactive visualization libraries integrated
- Limited drill-down capabilities in web interface
- No real-time filtering or advanced exploration tools
- Static plots rather than truly interactive visualizations

### S6P4: Archive for reproducibility
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Run specifications saved as JSON files including adapter specs and scenario configs
- Fixed random seed usage in sampling: `np.random.seed(0)` in `src/helm/benchmark/runner.py` line 119
- Scenario and model configuration preservation in JSON format
- Environment dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` with version constraints

**Limitations:**
- No automatic environment capture (no requirements freezing or container image creation)
- No checksumming or cryptographic verification of results
- Limited reproducibility metadata beyond basic configuration
- No version control integration for tracking configuration changes
- No automated environment specification packaging

### S6P5: Publish to appropriate channels
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- GitHub Actions workflows present in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Basic CI/CD pipeline with test automation (`test.yml`, `build-frontend.yml`)
- Public leaderboard hosting infrastructure (crfm-helm-public GCS bucket)
- Web server capability for results hosting

**Limitations:**
- No MLOps platform integrations (no MLflow, W&B, or Neptune connectors found)
- No model registry integration capabilities
- Limited webhook or API publishing mechanisms
- No automated result pushing to external platforms
- CI/CD focused on code testing rather than result publishing
