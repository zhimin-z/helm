## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/statistic.py` provides the `Stat` class with built-in statistical computation:
  - Mean, variance, standard deviation automatically computed via `_update_mean_variance_stddev()`
  - Min/max tracking with `self.min` and `self.max` attributes
  - Sum and sum of squares for statistical calculations
  - Support for merging statistics across instances with `merge()` method
- `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/summarize.py` aggregates statistics across multiple runs and contexts using `statistics.mean`, `statistics.median`
- Missing data handling through `add()` method that skips `None` values
- Custom aggregation functions supported through the metric system
**Limitations:**
- No built-in percentile calculations (though could be added via custom metrics)
- No weighted aggregation utilities (would require custom implementation)

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/metric_name.py` defines `MetricContext` for grouping instances by attributes like perturbations
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/bias_metrics.py` provides demographic stratification:
  - Race and gender categories with `RACE_CATEGORY`, `GENDER_CATEGORY`
  - Word list mappings for demographic groups in `RACE_TO_NAME_LISTS`, `GENDER_TO_WORD_LISTS`
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/decodingtrust_fairness_metrics.py` implements fairness analysis tools
- Schema system in `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/schema.py` supports grouping results by run groups and metric groups
- Perturbation system allows analysis across different conditions via `src/helm/benchmark/augmentations/`
**Limitations:**
- Limited multi-dimensional stratification - mainly supports single demographic attributes
- No built-in cross-tabulation utilities
- Fairness analysis is scenario-specific rather than general-purpose

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/create_plots.py` provides plotting infrastructure:
  - Uses matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization
  - Color palette support with `get_color_palette()`
  - Table parsing and visualization utilities
- Plotting dependencies in `pyproject.toml` include `matplotlib>=3.6.0`, `seaborn>=0.11.0`, `colorcet~=3.0`
- Basic calibration analysis in `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/basic_metrics.py` using `calibration` library
- Web frontend for result visualization via `helm-server` command
**Limitations:**
- No built-in ROC curve, precision-recall curve, or confusion matrix generation
- Limited diagnostic chart types - mostly basic plots and tables
- No interactive exploration tools beyond the web interface

### S5P4: Analyze performance-quality tradeoffs and failure patterns
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/efficiency_metrics.py` provides basic efficiency tracking
- Perturbation system in `src/helm/benchmark/augmentations/` allows robustness analysis
- Error analysis through comparison of perturbed vs original results
- Basic statistical analysis of failures through metrics aggregation
**Limitations:**
- No systematic failure pattern detection or clustering
- No latency vs accuracy curve generation
- Limited root cause analysis tools
- No automated bias detection beyond specific bias metrics

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/ranking_metrics.py` provides comprehensive ranking capabilities:
  - Support for NDCG, reciprocal rank, recall measures via `pytrec_eval`
  - Binary ranking with confidence-based sorting
  - Multiple ranking measures: `RECIP_RANK_MEASURE`, `SUCCESS_MEASURE`, `RECALL_MEASURE`, `NDCG_CUT_MEASURE`
- `src/helm/benchmark/presentation/summarize.py` generates leaderboards and comparison tables:
  - Model comparison across multiple metrics
  - Win rate calculations and aggregate scoring
  - LaTeX table generation for publication
- Web interface provides interactive leaderboards via `helm-server`
- Schema system supports grouping and filtering for targeted comparisons
- Multiple official leaderboards maintained (Capabilities, Safety, VHELM)
**Limitations:**
- No built-in statistical significance testing for model comparisons
- Limited baseline tracking beyond simple performance comparison
