# HELM - Step 4 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S4P1 | 2 | Basic output validation through output processors and format normalization, but no comprehensive safety filters |
| S4P2 | 3 | Comprehensive metric library covering text generation, retrieval, classification, and safety metrics |
| S4P3 | 2 | Partial LLM-as-judge support with some specialized evaluator models, but limited custom evaluator interfaces |
| S4P4 | 1 | Minimal statistical analysis - basic bootstrap testing in summarization, no comprehensive confidence intervals |

## Detailed Analysis

### S4P1: Validate and normalize model outputs
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Output Processing Framework**: HELM provides `OutputProcessingMetric` class in `src/helm/benchmark/metrics/output_processing_metric.py` that allows applying processors to completions before evaluation
- **Text Normalization**: Multiple normalization functions exist, such as `normalize_text()` in `evaluate_reference_metrics.py` and `_normalize_label_text()` in `classification_metrics.py`
- **Format Validation**: Basic output format checking through structured metrics like `ClassificationMetric` which validates generated classes against known labels
- **Example Configuration**: The `remove_deepseek_r1_thinking()` processor in `output_processors.py` shows pattern-based output cleaning

**Limitations:**
- No comprehensive safety filter pipeline
- Limited schema validation beyond basic text processing
- No dedicated content moderation beyond toxicity metrics
- Missing structured output validators for complex formats

### S4P2: Compute task-specific metrics
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Text Generation Metrics**: 
  - BLEU score via `MachineTranslationMetric` using sacrebleu (`machine_translation_metrics.py`)
  - ROUGE metrics in `SummarizationMetric` (`summarization_metrics.py`)
  - F1, exact match, prefix match in `BasicGenerationMetric` (`basic_metrics.py`)
  - BERTScore integration in summarization metrics
- **Retrieval/RAG Metrics**:
  - Ranking metrics including NDCG, MRR in `RankingMetric` (`ranking_metrics.py`)
  - Precision@k, Recall@k support through pytrec_eval integration
- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Comprehensive classification support with macro/micro F1, precision, recall (`classification_metrics.py`)
  - Multi-class and multi-label classification via `ClassificationMetric`
  - Calibration metrics through `compute_calibration_metrics()`
- **Safety Metrics**:
  - Toxicity measurement via `ToxicityMetric` using Perspective API (`toxicity_metrics.py`)
  - Bias measurement through `BiasMetric` (`bias_metrics.py`)
  - Multiple safety benchmark integrations (DecodingTrust, etc.)
- **Specialized Evaluators**:
  - COMET for machine translation (`comet_metric.py`)
  - Task-specific metrics for 80+ different scenarios

**Limitations:**
- Limited factuality checking (some QAFactEval integration but not comprehensive)
- Semantic similarity metrics not extensively integrated beyond BERTScore

### S4P3: Apply evaluator models
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **LLM-as-Judge Support**:
  - `LiveQAMetric` implements LLM-as-judge scoring (`live_qa_metrics.py`)
  - WildBench metrics use GPT-4o as judge (`wildbench_metrics.py`)
  - Prometheus-Vision integration for vision-language evaluation (`prometheus_vision_critique_metrics.py`)
- **Specialized Evaluator Models**:
  - COMET integration for machine translation quality (`comet_metric.py`) 
  - BERTScore for semantic similarity in summarization
  - Multiple instruction-following critique metrics
- **Model-based Scoring**:
  - GPT-4 based evaluation in multiple metrics (OmniMath, etc.)
  - Audio critique metrics using GPT-4 Audio
  - Vision critique models for multimodal evaluation

**Limitations:**
- No standardized custom evaluator interface
- Limited documentation on extending with new judge models  
- Most evaluator integrations are scenario-specific rather than general-purpose
- No unified API for plugging in arbitrary evaluator models

### S4P4: Calculate confidence intervals and statistical significance
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- **Basic Statistical Analysis**:
  - `Stat` class provides mean, variance, standard deviation calculation (`statistic.py`)
  - Population-level statistics computed across instances
- **Bootstrap Testing**:
  - Paired bootstrap test implementation in `_paired_bootstrap_test()` function (`summarization_metrics.py`)
  - Used for significance testing in human evaluation comparisons
- **Statistical Utilities**:
  - Basic aggregation and statistical measures in core `Stat` class
  - Per-instance and aggregated statistics tracking

**Limitations:**
- No comprehensive confidence interval computation across metrics
- Bootstrap testing only implemented for specific summarization scenarios
- Missing general statistical significance testing framework
- No uncertainty quantification for most metrics
- Limited statistical analysis beyond basic descriptive statistics

## Key Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Metric Coverage**: HELM provides extensive metric support across text generation, classification, retrieval, and safety domains
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between metrics, adapters, and scenarios allows extensibility
3. **Multi-Domain Support**: Covers language modeling, vision-language, audio, and multimodal evaluation
4. **Production-Ready**: Well-documented, actively maintained framework with extensive benchmarking capabilities

## Key Limitations  
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Limited confidence interval and significance testing capabilities
2. **Output Validation**: Basic validation without comprehensive safety filtering
3. **Evaluator Integration**: Partial support for custom evaluator models without standardized interfaces
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Missing sophisticated uncertainty quantification and statistical inference tools

## Overall Assessment
HELM provides strong support for core evaluation metrics (S4P2) with good coverage of text generation, classification, retrieval, and safety metrics. It has partial support for output validation (S4P1) and evaluator models (S4P3), but these areas could benefit from more comprehensive frameworks. Statistical analysis capabilities (S4P4) are the weakest area, with only basic statistical measures and limited bootstrap testing.

The framework excels at standardized benchmark evaluation but may require additional development for advanced statistical analysis and comprehensive output validation in production ML systems.
